## Components

### 1. **Turbocharger**
**Type:** Twin-scroll wastegate turbo
**Manufacturer:** Mitsubishi or BorgWarner (varies)
**Boost Pressure:** ~17-18 PSI

**Components:**
- Turbine housing (hot side)
- Compressor housing (cold side)
- Center housing (CHRA - bearing assembly)
- Wastegate actuator
- Oil feed line
- Oil return line
- Coolant lines

**Common Issues:**
- Turbo seal failure (oil in intake)
- Bearing wear (turbo whine)
- Wastegate rattle
- Oil feed line leaks

---

### 2. **Intercooler**
**Type:** Air-to-air front-mounted

**Function:** Cools compressed intake air

**Issues:**
- Leaks at end tanks
- Road debris damage
- Clamp failures

---

### 3. **Diverter/Bypass Valve**
**Location:** Intake manifold side
**Type:** Vacuum-operated diaphragm valve

**Function:**
- Releases boost pressure during throttle closure
- Prevents compressor surge

**Common Failure:**
- Diaphragm tears/punctures
- Symptoms: Loss of boost, hesitation, limp mode
- **Very common failure on N14**

---

### 4. **Boost Control Solenoid**
**Type:** Electronic N75 valve

**Function:** Controls wastegate vacuum signal

**Issues:**
- Electrical failure
- Vacuum leaks
- Overboosting/underboosting

---

### 5. **Intake Piping**
**Components:**
- Turbo outlet pipe
- Intercooler pipes
- Throttle body inlet pipe
- Various couplers and clamps

**Common Issues:**
- Coupler cracks
- Clamp loosening
- Boost leaks
