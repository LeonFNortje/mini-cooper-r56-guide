## 🔍 KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS

### Post-Turbo Replacement Issues:

**Most Common (30%):** Turbo oil feed line blockage/restriction
- **Solution:** Replace oil feed line, not just turbo
- **Cost:** R500-1,500

**Second (25%):** Carbon buildup on intake valves still present
- **Occurs:** As early as 24,000km
- **Solution:** Walnut blasting
- **Cost:** R3,000-6,000
- **Frequency:** Every 48,000-64,000km

**Third (20%):** Intercooler clogged with oil from old turbo
- **Solution:** Clean or replace intercooler
- **Cost:** R1,500-4,000

### Post-ECU Replacement Issues:

**Critical:** ECU MUST be programmed to your car
- VIN coding
- CAS/EWS synchronization
- Key programming
- Throttle adaptation

**Equipment Needed:** BMW ISTA software
**South Africa:** Limited shops have this
**Cost:** R2,000-5,000 for programming

**Common Problem:** Car won't start after ECU replacement
- **Cause:** Immobilizer not synced (90%)
- **Solution:** Professional programming required

### Post-Crankshaft Work Issues:

**Oil Pressure Specs (N14):**
- Idle (warm): 1.0-1.5 bar (normal), below 0.8 bar (low)
- 2,000 RPM: 2.5-3.5 bar
- 4,000 RPM: 3.5-4.5 bar

**Upgraded Pump:** +20% pressure at idle (1.2-1.5 bar)

**If Pressure Still Low:**
1. Oil pump not upgraded (40%)
2. Camshaft bearings not replaced (25%)
3. Oil passages restricted (20%)
4. Wrong oil viscosity (10%)
5. Faulty sensor (5%)

**Correct Oil:** 0W-40 synthetic (NOT 0W-30)
**South Africa:** Quality synthetic rated for high temp
