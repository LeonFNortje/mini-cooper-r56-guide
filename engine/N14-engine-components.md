## Major Components

### 1. **Timing Chain System**
**Location:** Front of engine, behind timing cover

**Components:**
- Timing chain
- Chain tensioner
- Upper chain guide (rail)
- Lower chain guide (rail)
- Timing chain cover

**Critical Points:**
- Known weak point on N14 (2007-2010)
- Tensioner failure leads to "death rattle"
- Chain stretches over time

**Related Files:**
- See: `diagnostics/timing-chain-diagnosis.md`

---

### 2. **Valvetrain**
**Components:**
- Intake camshaft (with Valvetronic eccentric shaft)
- Exhaust camshaft
- Valvetronic servo motor
- Intake valves (4 per cylinder)
- Exhaust valves (4 per cylinder)
- Rocker arms
- Hydraulic valve lifters

**Issues:**
- Carbon buildup on intake valves (direct injection)
- Rocker cover gasket leaks

---

### 3. **Cylinder Head**
**Material:** Aluminum alloy

**Components:**
- Combustion chambers
- Valve seats
- Spark plug wells
- Coolant passages
- Oil passages

**Common Problems:**
- Spark plug well oil leaks
- Cracked between valves (rare, high stress)

---

### 4. **Block and Pistons**
**Components:**
- Aluminum engine block
- Cast iron cylinder liners
- Forged pistons
- Connecting rods
- Forged crankshaft
- Main bearings
- Rod bearings

**Issues:**
- Oil consumption through piston rings
- Bore scoring (rare but catastrophic)

---

### 5. **Oil System**
**Components:**
- Oil pump (chain driven)
- Oil pan/sump
- Oil filter housing
- Oil cooler
- PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve
- Oil passages

**Common Leaks:**
- Oil pan gasket
- Oil filter housing gasket
- Front/rear main seals
- Valve cover gasket

**Capacity:** ~4.5 quarts with filter

---

### 6. **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP)**
**Location:** Driven by exhaust camshaft lobe

**Function:**
- Provides fuel at 200+ bar pressure
- Feeds direct injection system

**Common Issues:**
- Complete failure (loss of power)
- Intermittent failure
- Metal contamination in fuel system

**Related Files:**
- See: `fuel-system/HPFP-diagnosis.md`

---

### 7. **Vacuum Pump**
**Location:** End of exhaust camshaft

**Function:**
- Provides vacuum for brake booster
- Driven off cam lobe

**Critical Issue:**
- If seized, shears timing chain
- Catastrophic engine failure

**Prevention:**
- Replace at 80-160k km preventatively

### 8. **Thermostat Housing**
**Location:** Left side of engine, near exhaust manifold

**Material:** Plastic composite

**Common Issue:**
- Heat from exhaust causes cracking
- Coolant leaks
- Overheating

---

### 9. **Water Pump**
**Type:** Electric (separate from engine)

**Location:** Front of engine

**Issues:**
- Bearing failure
- Coolant leaks
- Electrical connector corrosion

---

### 10. **Sensors**
**Critical Sensors:**
- Camshaft position sensors (2)
- Crankshaft position sensor
- Knock sensors (2)
- Oxygen sensors (2-4)
- MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor
- MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensor
- Coolant temperature sensor
- Oil pressure sensor
- Oil level sensor

---

## Recommended Maintenance Components

### Every 5,000 Miles:
- Engine oil (0W-40 synthetic)
- Oil filter

### Every 30,000 Miles:
- Intake valve carbon cleaning
- PCV valve inspection

### Every 60,000 Miles:
- Spark plugs
- Ignition coils (inspect)

### Preventative Replacements:
- Timing chain tensioner (if not done, do ASAP)
- Vacuum pump (80-160k km)
- Thermostat housing (at first sign of leak)
