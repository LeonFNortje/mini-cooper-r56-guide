## Component Description

The timing chain connects the crankshaft to the camshafts, ensuring valves open and close at precisely the correct time relative to piston position. Unlike a timing belt, chains are designed to last longer but the N14's timing chain system has a **well-documented design flaw**.

**What Makes Up the System:**
- Timing chain (single chain design)
- Hydraulic tensioner (pressure-fed from oil system)
- Upper guide rail (plastic)
- Lower guide rail (plastic)
- Tensioner rail
- Sprockets (crankshaft, intake cam, exhaust cam)

## 🚨 THE "DEATH RATTLE" - Most Common Failure

### What Is The Death Rattle?

A loud rattling/chattering noise from the front of the engine that occurs on **cold start** and lasts 2-5 seconds before quieting down. This is the sound of a loose timing chain slapping against the guides.

**Stages of Death Rattle:**

**Stage 1: Early Warning (60,000-80,000 km)**
- Very faint rattle on cold start
- Lasts 1-2 seconds
- May not hear it every time
- **Action:** Begin planning for replacement

**Stage 2: Moderate (80,000-100,000 km)**
- Clear rattling noise on every cold start
- Lasts 2-5 seconds
- Sounds like marbles in a can
- **Action:** Schedule replacement within 5,000-10,000 km

**Stage 3: Severe (100,000-120,000 km)**
- Loud rattling on cold start
- May continue after warm-up
- Check engine light may appear
- **Action:** URGENT - Replace immediately

**Stage 4: Critical Failure**
- Continuous rattling even when warm
- Loss of power
- Check engine light ON
- **Action:** STOP DRIVING - Risk of catastrophic failure

## Failure Modes

### Failure Mode 1: Timing Chain Stretch

**Primary Cause:** Design flaw in original tensioner + oil starvation

**Why It Happens:**
1. Chain wears over time (normal)
2. Hydraulic tensioner cannot maintain proper tension (design flaw)
3. Chain becomes loose and starts to slap guides
4. Slapping causes accelerated wear
5. Chain stretches beyond tensioner's ability to compensate

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ **Death rattle** on cold start (2-5 seconds)
- ✅ Rattling disappears when oil pressure builds up
- ✅ Check engine light (later stages)
- ✅ P0016, P0008, P0009 codes (camshaft/crankshaft correlation)
- ✅ Loss of power (timing retarded)
- ✅ Rough idle
- ✅ Poor fuel economy

**Testing Procedures:**

1. **Listen Test (Most Common):**
   - Cold start engine (hasn't run for 4+ hours)
   - Listen for rattling from front of engine
   - Time how long rattle lasts
   - Record if it goes away or continues

2. **Scan Tool Diagnosis:**
   - Connect OBD2 scanner
   - Check for codes:
     - P0016: Camshaft position correlation
     - P0008: Intake camshaft position system performance
     - P0009: Exhaust camshaft position system performance
   - Review live data: Camshaft timing values

3. **Timing Chain Stretch Measurement (Requires Special Tool):**
   - Special BMW tool measures chain stretch
   - Typically only done by specialists
   - Can measure stretch in degrees

**Repair Required:**
- ✅ Complete timing chain kit replacement
- ✅ Updated tensioner (MUST use updated design)
- ✅ Both guide rails
- ✅ All gaskets
- ✅ Timing cover seal

**Cost:** R12,000-25,000 (parts + labor)

**Prevention:**
- Regular oil changes every 6,000-8,000 km (NOT BMW's 15,000 km interval)
- Use quality 0W-40 synthetic oil (NOT 0W-30)
- Monitor for early warning signs
- Consider preventative replacement at 80,000 km on 2007-2009 engines

---

### Failure Mode 2: Timing Chain Tensioner Failure

**Primary Cause:** Design flaw in original hydraulic tensioner

**Why It Happens:**
The original tensioner design cannot maintain consistent oil pressure to keep the chain tight, especially during cold starts when oil pressure is initially low.

**Symptoms:**
- Identical to chain stretch (death rattle)
- Can fail suddenly without warning
- May fail even with relatively new chain

**Testing:**
- Cannot be tested separately from chain stretch
- Replacement is preventative

**Repair Required:**
- MUST use updated tensioner design
- Never replace tensioner without replacing chain
- Never replace chain without replacing tensioner

**Cost:** Included in timing chain kit (R12,000-25,000)

**Updated Tensioner Design:**
- BMW issued updated part number
- Improved oil pressure retention
- More robust internal spring
- **Critical:** Always verify you're getting updated design

---

### Failure Mode 3: Upper Guide Rail Cracking/Breaking

**Primary Cause:** Chain slap from loose tensioner

**Why It Happens:**
- Loose chain slaps against plastic guide rail
- Plastic becomes brittle from heat cycles
- Cracks develop in high-stress areas
- Pieces can break off into oil pan

**Symptoms:**
- Rattling noise (same as chain stretch)
- Sudden loud noise if rail breaks
- Plastic pieces in oil pan (found during oil change)
- Can cause immediate chain jump if rail fails completely

**Testing:**
- Visual inspection requires timing cover removal
- Plastic pieces in oil during oil change is indicator
- Cannot test without disassembly

**Repair Required:**
- Replace as part of complete timing chain kit
- NEVER reuse old guide rails
- Inspect oil pan for plastic debris

**Cost:** Included in timing chain kit

---

### Failure Mode 4: Lower Guide Rail Wear

**Primary Cause:** Normal chain wear + accelerated wear from loose chain

**Why It Happens:**
- Chain runs along lower guide continuously
- Wear is normal but accelerated if chain is loose
- Often wears through to metal backing

**Symptoms:**
- Often asymptomatic until severe
- May contribute to rattling noise
- Can cause sudden chain jump if worn through

**Testing:**
- Only visible with timing cover removed
- Check during chain replacement

**Repair Required:**
- Always replace with timing chain kit
- Never reuse

**Cost:** Included in timing chain kit

---

### Failure Mode 5: Catastrophic Failure - Chain Jump/Break

**Cause:** Ignored death rattle, complete tensioner failure, broken guide rail

**What Happens:**
1. Chain jumps one or more teeth on sprockets
2. Valve timing is suddenly completely wrong
3. Valves contact pistons (interference engine)
4. Bent valves, damaged pistons, possibly damaged cylinder head

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden loss of all power
- Loud metallic knocking/clanging
- Engine won't start
- No compression in one or more cylinders
- Catastrophic noise from engine

**Testing:**
- Compression test shows zero or very low compression
- Borescope inspection shows bent valves or piston damage
- Timing cover removal shows chain off sprockets

**Repair Required:**
- ⚠️ **ENGINE REBUILD OR REPLACEMENT**
- Timing chain kit
- Cylinder head replacement or extensive rebuild
- New valves (possibly all 16)
- Pistons if damaged
- Possible crankshaft damage

**Cost:** R40,000-100,000+ (can exceed cost of used engine)

**Prevention:**
- **NEVER IGNORE DEATH RATTLE**
- Replace chain at first signs of rattle
- Don't wait for check engine light

## 🔧 Prevention & Maintenance Tips

### Best Practices to Extend Chain Life:

**1. Oil Changes Every 6,000-8,000 km:**
- Most important preventative measure
- Use quality 0W-40 synthetic
- Never extend beyond 8,000 km in SA climate

**2. Use Correct Oil Viscosity:**
- ✅ **0W-40** (recommended for SA)
- ❌ NOT 0W-30 (insufficient protection)
- Brands: Castrol Edge 0W-40, Mobil 1 0W-40, Liqui Moly 0W-40

**3. Check Oil Level Weekly:**
- N14 engines consume oil
- Low oil = insufficient tensioner pressure
- Top up between changes as needed

**4. Warm Up Engine Properly:**
- Don't rev engine when cold
- Allow 30-60 seconds at idle before driving
- Drive gently until oil temperature reaches 80-90°C

**5. Address Oil Leaks Immediately:**
- Oil leaks = low oil level
- Low oil = chain wear

**6. Listen for Death Rattle:**
- Every cold start, listen carefully
- Act early when rattle first appears
- Don't wait for it to get worse

### For 2007-2009 Engines (Highest Risk):

Consider **preventative replacement** at 80,000 km even without symptoms if:
- You plan to keep the car long-term
- Service history is unknown
- Oil changes were not done every 6-8k km
- You want peace of mind

**Cost now:** R12,000-25,000
**Cost if it fails:** R40,000-100,000+

---

## 📋 Pre-Purchase Inspection (Buying Used N14)

### What to Check:

**1. Cold Start Test (ESSENTIAL):**
- Car must be cold (not run for 4+ hours)
- Start engine and listen carefully
- Any rattle = budget R12,000-25,000 for chain

**2. Service History:**
- Look for timing chain replacement records
- Check oil change intervals
- Frequent 6-8k km oil changes = well maintained

**3. Scan for Codes:**
- Bring OBD2 scanner
- Check for P0016, P0008, P0009
- Any timing codes = walk away or heavily negotiate

**4. Current Mileage:**
- 60,000-100,000 km on 2007-2009 = chain likely needs replacement soon
- 100,000+ km on any year = ask if chain has been done

### Price Negotiation:

**If Death Rattle Present:**
- Deduct R15,000-25,000 from asking price
- Budget for immediate replacement
- Consider walking away if price isn't adjusted

**If No Records of Chain Replacement:**
- Assume it will need to be done soon
- Factor into purchase price
