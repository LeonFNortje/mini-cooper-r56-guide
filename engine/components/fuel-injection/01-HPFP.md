## Component Description

### What Is The HPFP?

The High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) is a mechanically-driven pump that increases fuel pressure from ~4 bar (low pressure system) to ~100-200 bar (high pressure) required for direct injection.

**How It Works:**
1. Low pressure pump in tank supplies fuel at ~4 bar
2. HPFP takes this fuel and compresses it to 100-200 bar
3. High pressure fuel stored in fuel rail
4. Injectors spray fuel directly into combustion chamber at precisely timed moments

**Why High Pressure Is Needed:**
- Direct injection requires fuel to overcome cylinder pressure
- During compression stroke, cylinder pressure is 15-30 bar
- Fuel must be sprayed at much higher pressure to atomize properly
- Poor atomization = poor combustion = poor performance

### Location & Access:

**Where to Find It:**
- Top/rear of engine
- Between cylinder head and firewall
- Driven by intake camshaft (mechanical drive)
- Visible with engine cover removed

**Identification:**
- Cylindrical metal pump body
- High pressure fuel line coming out (metal braided)
- Low pressure fuel line in (rubber)
- Electrical connector on top

## Common Failure Modes

### Failure Mode 1: Internal Seal Failure (Most Common)

**What Happens:**
- Internal seals wear out
- Fuel leaks internally (not externally visible)
- Pump cannot build/maintain pressure
- Fuel pressure drops below ~80 bar
- Engine won't start or runs very poorly

**Symptoms:**

**Sudden Failure:**
- ✅ Won't start (cranks but doesn't fire)
- ✅ May start but immediately stalls
- ✅ No warning beforehand
- ✅ May happen overnight (starts fine, then doesn't)

**Gradual Failure (Less Common):**
- ⚠️ Hard starting (extended cranking)
- ⚠️ Hesitation on acceleration
- ⚠️ Loss of power under load
- ⚠️ Rough running
- ⚠️ Check engine light: P0087 (fuel pressure low)

**Testing:**

1. **Scan Tool - Fuel Pressure:**
   - Connect OBD2 scanner with live data
   - Check "Fuel Rail Pressure" value
   - Key on, engine off: Should see 5 bar
   - Running at idle: Should see 80-100 bar
   - Running at 3,000 RPM: Should see 120-150 bar
   - **If pressure low:** HPFP failing

2. **Listen Test:**
   - Key on (don't start)
   - Listen near HPFP
   - Should hear mechanical whirring/ticking
   - If silent: May indicate failure

3. **Fuel Pressure Gauge (Most Accurate):**
   - Requires special high-pressure gauge
   - Connects to fuel rail test port
   - Directly measures pressure
   - Most shops have this tool

**Repair:** Replace HPFP
**Cost:** R6,000-12,000 (parts + labor)
**Time:** 2-3 hours (shop) / 3-5 hours (DIY)

---

### Failure Mode 2: Camshaft Lobe Wear

**What Happens:**
- HPFP is driven by a lobe on intake camshaft
- If camshaft lobe wears down, pump doesn't get full stroke
- Reduced stroke = reduced pressure
- Less common than seal failure but does occur

**Symptoms:**
- Gradual loss of fuel pressure over time
- Progressively harder starting
- Loss of power
- Same symptoms as seal failure but slower onset

**Testing:**
- Fuel pressure test (same as above)
- Requires valve cover removal to inspect cam lobe
- Measure lobe height with micrometer
- Compare to factory specs

**Repair:**
- Replace HPFP
- May also need camshaft replacement
- Much more expensive if cam is worn

**Cost:**
- HPFP only: R6,000-12,000
- Camshaft + HPFP: R15,000-30,000

**Mileage:** Usually 160,000+ km (high mileage issue)

---

### Failure Mode 3: External Fuel Leak

**What Happens:**
- O-ring seals fail
- Fuel leaks externally (visible)
- Fuel pressure drops
- Fire hazard!

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Fuel smell in engine bay
- ✅ Visible fuel leak near HPFP
- ✅ Fuel dripping onto engine
- ✅ Hard starting / won't start
- ✅ Check engine light: P0087

**Testing:**
- Visual inspection (fuel wetness)
- Fuel smell
- Look for drips

**Repair:**
- Replace O-rings if minor
- Replace HPFP if pump body leaking
- **URGENT** - Fire risk

**Cost:**
- O-rings only: R800-2,000
- Full pump: R6,000-12,000

**Safety:**
- **DO NOT DRIVE** if leaking fuel
- **FIRE HAZARD**
- Repair immediately

---

### Failure Mode 4: Electrical Failure

- Test sensor with multimeter
- Resistance test

**Repair:**
- Replace pressure sensor (R1,500-3,500)
- Repair wiring if damaged
- Clean connectors

**Cost:** R1,500-5,000 (usually less than full pump replacement)

---

### Failure Mode 5: Contaminated Fuel Damage

**What Happens:**
- Water or debris in fuel
- Damages pump internals
- Seals fail prematurely
- Pump seizes or fails

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden failure after refueling
- Won't start
- May hear grinding/scraping from pump

**Testing:**

## Testing Procedures

### Test 1: OBD2 Scanner Fuel Pressure Reading

**Equipment:**
- OBD2 scanner with live data capability
- Examples: Carly, Autel, Foxwell, generic scanners

**Procedure:**
1. Connect scanner to OBD2 port (under dashboard, driver's side)
2. Turn key to ON position (don't start)
3. Navigate to "Live Data" or "PID Data"
4. Find "Fuel Rail Pressure" or "High Pressure Fuel"
5. Observe value:
   - Key on, engine off: ~5 bar (residual)
   - Cranking: Should rise to 40-60 bar
   - Idle: 80-100 bar
   - 3,000 RPM: 120-150 bar
   - Full throttle: 150-200 bar

**Results:**
- If pressure meets specs: HPFP likely okay
- If pressure low at any point: HPFP failing
- If pressure zero: HPFP completely failed

**Cost:** Free if you have scanner (R800-5,000 to buy)

### Test 2: Listen Test

**Procedure:**
1. Remove engine cover
2. Turn key to ON (don't start)
3. Listen near HPFP (rear/top of engine)
4. Should hear mechanical whirring/ticking for 2-3 seconds
5. This is pump priming

**Results:**
- Hear pump: Probably okay (but pressure test needed)
- Silent: Pump may not be running (failure)
- Grinding noise: Internal damage

**Cost:** Free

**Limitation:** Doesn't confirm pressure, only that pump tries to run

### Test 3: Fuel Pressure Gauge Test (Most Accurate)

**Equipment:**
- High pressure fuel gauge (0-300 bar)
- Adapter for BMW/MINI fuel rail

**Procedure:**
1. Relieve fuel pressure (pull fuel pump fuse, run engine until stall)
2. Connect gauge to fuel rail test port
3. Turn key on, observe pressure rise
4. Start engine, observe pressure at idle and varying RPM

**Results:**
- Confirms exact fuel pressure
- Most definitive test

**Cost:**
- Professional shop: R300-800 (diagnostic fee)
- Buy gauge: R2,000-5,000

## Prevention & Maintenance

### Can HPFP Failure Be Prevented?

**Partially, but not completely:**

HPFP is a wear item that will eventually fail. However, you can extend its life:

### 1. Use Quality Fuel

**Why:**
- Contaminated fuel damages pump
- Water in fuel corrodes internals
- Debris damages seals

**How:**
- Use reputable stations (Shell, BP, Engen)
- Avoid questionable stations
- Avoid filling up during station's tank refill (sediment)

**Benefit:** May extend life by 20-30%

### 2. Replace Fuel Filter on Schedule

**Schedule:**
- Every **64,000-96,000 km**
- Or if you suspect fuel contamination

**Why:**
- Catches debris before it reaches HPFP
- Clogged filter causes HPFP to work harder

**Cost:** R400-800 (filter) + R500-1,500 (labor)

### 3. Regular Oil Changes

**Why:**
- HPFP is lubricated by engine oil
- Dirty oil = accelerated wear

**Schedule:**
- Every **6,000-8,000 km**
- Use quality 0W-40 synthetic

**Benefit:** Extends HPFP life significantly

### 4. Address Check Engine Lights Promptly

**Why:**
- P0087 (low pressure) may appear before complete failure
- Gives you warning to replace before stranded

**Action:**
- Don't ignore codes
- Have diagnosed immediately
- Plan for replacement

### 5. Don't Run Tank Too Low

**Why:**
- Low fuel level allows sediment from tank bottom to enter system
- Can damage low pressure pump and HPFP

**Practice:**
- Refuel when tank hits 1/4
- Don't run below 1/4 tank regularly
