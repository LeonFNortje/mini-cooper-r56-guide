## 🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS

### **After Major Repairs, Watch For:**

**Immediately (First Week):**
- Oil pressure (install mechanical gauge)
- Any leaks (oil, coolant, boost)
- Unusual noises
- Boost reaching proper level (1.1-1.2 bar)

**Break-In Period (First 3,000 km):**
- Oil change at 500 km
- Oil change at 1,500 km  
- Oil change at 3,000 km
- Check oil level every 100 km initially

**Still Common Issues:**
- Carbon buildup (not fixed by turbo/ECU/crank work)
- HPFP may still fail
- Bypass valve if not replaced
- Thermostat housing prone to cracking
- Vacuum pump (original if not replaced)

**Preventative Spending:**
- R15,000-35,000 additional recommended
- Prevents next round of failures
- Much cheaper than waiting for failures

### **Critical for N14 Ownership:**

1. **Oil changes every 6,000-8,000 km** (NOT BMW's 10-15k interval)
2. **Check oil level weekly**
3. **Carbon cleaning every 48,000 km**
4. **Timing chain if 2007-2009 and not done**
5. **Use 0W-40 synthetic oil** (NOT 0W-30)
