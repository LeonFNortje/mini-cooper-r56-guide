## Major Components

### 1. **Radiator**
**Location:** Front of vehicle
**Type:** Aluminum core with plastic end tanks

**Function:** Primary heat dissipation

**Common Issues:**
- End tank cracking
- Leak at hose connections
- Fin damage from road debris

---

### 2. **Electric Water Pump**
**Location:** Front of engine
**Type:** Electronically controlled variable speed

**Function:**
- Circulates coolant through engine
- Variable speed based on temperature

**Common Issues:**
- Bearing failure (whining noise)
- Electrical connector corrosion
- Housing leaks
- Impeller failure

**Symptoms:**
- Overheating
- Coolant leak under car
- Whining noise from engine bay

---

### 3. **Thermostat and Housing**
**Location:** Left side of engine, near exhaust manifold
**Type:** Electronically controlled map thermostat
**Material:** Plastic housing with metal components

**Opening Temperature:** Variable (controlled by ECU)

**Common Issues:**
- **Housing cracks** (very common due to heat from exhaust)
- Thermostat stuck open (slow warm-up)
- Thermostat stuck closed (overheating)
- O-ring leaks

**Symptoms:**
- Coolant leak from left side of engine
- Overheating
- Slow engine warm-up
- Check engine light

### 4. **Expansion Tank**
**Location:** Right side of engine bay
**Material:** Translucent plastic

**Function:**
- Allows coolant expansion
- System filling point
- Houses pressure cap

**Common Issues:**
- Cap failure (pressure loss)
- Tank cracking
- Level sensor failure

---

### 5. **Coolant Hoses**
**Types:**
- Upper radiator hose
- Lower radiator hose
- Heater hoses (2)
- Bypass hoses
- Turbo coolant lines

**Common Issues:**
- Perishing/cracking with age
- Clamp failures
- Turbo coolant line leaks

---

### 6. **Cooling Fans**
**Type:** Electric (1 or 2 depending on A/C)
**Location:** Behind radiator

**Control:** ECU controlled based on coolant temp

**Common Issues:**
- Fan motor failure
- Resistor failure
- Wiring issues
- Fan controller module failure

---

### 7. **Coolant Temperature Sensor**
**Location:** Cylinder head

**Function:** Reports engine temp to ECU

**Issues:**
- Sensor failure (incorrect readings)
- Wiring corrosion

---

## Coolant Specifications

**Type:** BMW/MINI Coolant (Blue)
**Mix:** 50/50 coolant to distilled water
**Capacity:** ~6.5 quarts total system

**Replacement Interval:** Every 4 years or as needed
