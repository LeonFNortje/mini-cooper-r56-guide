# N14 Oil System Diagnosis
## Oil Pressure, Leaks, and Consumption

**For detailed oil system information, see:**

- [Oil Pump Guide](../engine/components/lubrication/01-oil-pump.md) - Complete oil pump failure guide with post-crankshaft work monitoring
- [Valve Cover Guide](../engine/components/cylinder-head/04-valve-cover.md) - Most common oil leak source
- [Post-Major-Repair Diagnosis](post-major-repair-diagnosis.md) - Oil pressure after crankshaft work

## Quick Oil System Issues:

### Low Oil Pressure:
- **See:** [Oil Pump Component Guide](../engine/components/lubrication/01-oil-pump.md)
- Critical after crankshaft/bearing work
- Install mechanical gauge to monitor
- Target: 1.5+ bar idle, 4.0+ bar at 4,000 RPM

### Oil Leaks:
- **Valve Cover Gasket** (most common) - See: [Valve Cover Guide](../engine/components/cylinder-head/04-valve-cover.md)
- **Oil Filter Housing** - Common leak point
- **Oil Pan Gasket** - Less common
- **Turbo Oil Lines** - Check after turbo replacement

### Oil Consumption:
- **Normal for N14:** Up to 1L per 1,600km (BMW spec)
- **Causes:** Turbo seals, piston rings, valve stem seals
- **Monitor:** Check level weekly
- **See:** [Post-Major-Repair Guide](post-major-repair-diagnosis.md) for post-rebuild expectations
