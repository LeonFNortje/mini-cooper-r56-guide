# Timing Chain Diagnosis - N14 Engine

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE - "Death Rattle"

This is the **#1 most serious problem** with the N14 engine (2007-2010). If you have a 2008-2009 Cooper S and haven't had the timing chain tensioner replaced, **do it ASAP**.

---

## Symptoms

### Early Warning Signs:
- ✓ Rattling noise on cold start (first 2-3 seconds)
- ✓ Noise goes away after engine warms up
- ✓ Noise louder in cold weather
- ✓ Sounds like marbles in a can

### Advanced Symptoms:
- ✓ Rattling noise continues after warm-up
- ✓ Rattling during acceleration
- ✓ Check engine light (timing-related codes)
- ✓ Rough idle
- ✓ Misfires

### Catastrophic Failure:
- ✓ Complete loss of power
- ✓ Engine won't start
- ✓ **Valves hit pistons** (bent valves, damaged pistons)
- ✓ **Engine destruction**

## Root Cause

**Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:**

The N14 (2007-2010) uses a hydraulic timing chain tensioner that is **known to fail prematurely**.

**Failure Mechanism:**
1. Tensioner loses hydraulic pressure
2. Chain becomes loose
3. Chain slaps against timing cover ("death rattle")
4. Chain stretches
5. Chain guides break
6. Chain jumps timing or breaks
7. Valves contact pistons = **engine destroyed**

**Contributing Factors:**
- Low oil level (accelerates wear)
- Irregular oil changes
- High oil consumption (common on N14)
- Design flaw in early tensioners

---

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Listen for Rattle
**Test:** Cold start the engine

**Normal:** Quiet start, no unusual noises
**Abnormal:** Rattling for 2-3 seconds (early stage) or continuous (advanced)

**Location:** Front of engine, timing cover area (driver's side)

---

### Step 2: Check Oil Level
**Critical:** Low oil accelerates timing chain wear

**Procedure:**
1. Park on level ground
2. Engine warm, turn off, wait 5 minutes
3. Pull dipstick, wipe, reinsert, check

**Result:**
- Oil at MIN or below → **Add oil immediately**
- Oil consumption high → Monitor every 800 km

**Related:** [Oil System](oil-system.md)

---

### Step 3: Visual Inspection
**Access:** Remove engine cover

**Check for:**
- Oil leaks at timing cover
- Oil leaks at valve cover
- Visible timing cover damage

---

### Step 4: Scan for Codes
**Use:** OBD-II scanner

**Related Codes:**
- P0016: Camshaft/Crankshaft correlation
- P0008: Bank 1 timing over-advanced
- P0009: Bank 1 timing over-retarded
- P0340: Camshaft position sensor
- P0300-P0304: Misfires (from timing issues)

**Note:** Timing chain issues may or may not throw codes early on

---

### Step 5: Professional Inspection
**Recommended if rattling present**

**Requires:**
- Removal of valve cover
- Visual inspection of chain, guides, tensioner
- Check chain stretch with special tool

**Cost:** $200-400 for inspection

---

## Confirmation Tests

### Visual Inspection (Valve Cover Off):
**Checks:**
- ✓ Chain tensioner movement
- ✓ Chain guide condition
- ✓ Chain stretch measurement
- ✓ Upper guide rail cracks

### Borescope Inspection:
**Alternative:** Inspect through oil fill without disassembly
- Less accurate but cheaper
- Can see tensioner and upper guide

## Decision Tree

```
COLD START RATTLE?
│
├─ YES, 2-3 seconds only
│  └─ Early stage failure
│     → Replace timing chain kit SOON (weeks)
│
├─ YES, continuous rattling
│  └─ Advanced failure
│     → Replace timing chain kit IMMEDIATELY (days)
│     → DO NOT DRIVE HARD
│
├─ YES, plus misfires/codes
│  └─ Critical failure
│     → TOW to shop
│     → May already have internal damage
│
└─ NO rattle, 2008-2009 model
   └─ Preventative replacement recommended
      → Before 130,000 km
```

## Repair Options

### Option 1: Timing Chain Tensioner Only
**When:** Very early stage, confirmed tensioner only
**Cost:** $800-1,200
**Parts:** Tensioner only
**Risk:** Chain may already be stretched

**Not Recommended** - Band-aid fix

---

### Option 2: Full Timing Chain Kit
**When:** Any rattling present
**Cost:** $1,500-2,500
**Parts:**
- Timing chain
- Tensioner
- Upper guide rail
- Lower guide rail
- Gaskets

**Recommended** - Complete fix

**Additional:** Often done with:
- Vacuum pump replacement ($200-400 more)
- Water pump replacement ($200-400 more)
- Thermostat housing ($100-200 more)

---

### Option 3: Preventative Replacement
**When:** 2008-2009 model, no symptoms yet
**Cost:** Same as Option 2
**Benefit:** Peace of mind, prevents catastrophic failure

**Highly Recommended for 2008-2009 N14 engines**

**BMW/MINI OEM:**
- Timing chain: 11317570692
- Tensioner: 11317546467 (updated version)
- Upper guide: 11317548216
- Lower guide: 11317529157

**Aftermarket:**
- Febi, Swag, Corteco (good quality)
- INA timing chain kits

**Note:** Use updated tensioner, not original failing design

---

## Labor Time

**Book Time:** 8-12 hours
**Actual Time:** 10-14 hours (varies by shop experience)

**Why so long?**
- Front of engine disassembly
- Requires special tools
- Timing marks must be precise
- Multiple gaskets to replace

---

## Prevention

### If You Haven't Replaced Yet:
1. **Check oil level WEEKLY**
2. Change oil every 8,000 km (not 10-15k)
3. Use quality 0W-40 synthetic
4. Listen for rattle at every start
5. Budget for replacement

### After Replacement:
1. Continue 5,000 mile oil changes
2. Monitor oil consumption
3. Use quality oil only
