# Vacuum Pump Diagnosis

## N14 Vacuum Pump Issues

The vacuum pump on N14 engines (2007-2010) is driven by the camshaft - a known design flaw.

### Critical Information:

- **Location:** Mounted on camshaft (dangerous design)
- **Failure Risk:** Can destroy entire engine if it seizes
- **Replacement:** 130,000-160,000 km preventatively
- **Cost:** R3,000-6,000 (SA)

### Symptoms of Failure:
- Hard brake pedal
- Poor brake assist
- Rattling/grinding noise from vacuum pump
- Oil contamination

**Note:** The N18 engine (2011+) moved the vacuum pump off the camshaft, fixing this design flaw.
